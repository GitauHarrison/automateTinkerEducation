# Automating Mundane Tasks at Tinker Education

Some of the most boring things that I have to do every day at work include:

1. Signing in to GSuite
2. Signing in to Slack and posting my commute time
3. Logging in to Trello and checking the common boards

Other things include:

* Sending notification emails to parents
* Checking students' content on their e-Learning platform
